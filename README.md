# RockPaperScissors
A small project built in C# to test what I've learned so far.

I'm following O'Reilly's Head First C# book and figured it was time to try and create my own project and see if I could figure out how to make it work, including WPF with buttons, textbox, etc. I'm really posting so I can get input on how I've implemented my logic, how my code is designed, and if there are best practices that I don't know that would make the readability and further development of this project or future projects easier.

Thanks for checking it out.

No, I have no idea how to compile this into a program for you to run. I'll also accept coaching for that too!
